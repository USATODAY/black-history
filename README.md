##Development

The requirements for this project are Node.js, Bower and Grunt. 

To install node with Hombrew:
`brew install node`

Or head over to the [Node website](http://nodejs.org/) and install from there.
Once Node is installed, install Grunt with
`npm install -g grunt-cli`

and install Bower with 
`npm install -g bower`

Once those dependencies are set up, from this repository run `npm install`, then run `grunt`


##Javascript tests

Tests are stored in the spec folder, and written using the [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) framework. To run tests, run `grunt test`. There is some test coverage, but it is incomplete.
